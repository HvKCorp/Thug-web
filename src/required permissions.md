# What permissions? 
Well My bot requires Some permissions for each and every command to function normally some extremely important permissions are: `view channels`,`send messages`,`read message history`. If these permissions are not granted to the bot it results in sever crashes and bot doesn't work in those servers. These crashes not always watched by me and I can't warn the server admins of what they doing (since I'm not in server neither I want to misuse my bot's powers too) So I initially make the bot force leave does servers since the problems logged in a Channel I make the bot leave the correct server. I recently improved set channel command but it didn't helped I'll improve it more and make it send a DM to the cmd user that the bot is missing perms. Please do make sure the following perms are granted to the bot:

# Basic Required Permissions:
- `View Channels`
- `Send Messages`
- `Send Messages In Threads`
- `Embed Links`
- `Attach Files`
- `Add Reactions`
- `Use External Emoji`
- `Use External Stickers`
- `Read Message History`
- `Send TTS`
- `Use Application Commands`
