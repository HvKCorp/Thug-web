# What is AI? 
AI: Artificial intelligence 
My bot can use it's AI to chat with ppl but not do anything a robot can do (common sense tbh).
This probably is one of the most used thing but looks like ppl think setting it is kinda complicated.
But it is as simple as setting up bot channel Here's what to do:

# What to do?
## Step 1:
### Create a channel 
It is recommended to create separate ai channel since it works without prefix and any additional words it will respond with almost all your messages.
And as I said it responds to all messages you should not set ai channel same as the channel setted for usage of bot commands.

## Step 2:
### Set the bot AI channel
All you need to do is run: cool ai <ai channel: channel mention> or cool ai (if running the command in same channel as the one you want to set. 

# OverView
## Command name : 
```
cool ai
```
## Fields: 
Ai channel: Channel mention
## Required Fields
N/A
## Permissions you need to run this command:
manage channels
## Permissions Bot needs:
View channels, Send messages, read message history.
## Additional:
This command should be used in a separate channel since it works without prefix and replies to all the messages sent it that channel.
