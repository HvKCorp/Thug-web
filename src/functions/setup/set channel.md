# What is set channel? 

Set channel is a command in Livin' in Thug bot that will let the commands be used only in a specific channel if a user tries to run command in other channel there will be no reply it is required by the bot to prevent crashes if took send message permissions from the bot in a channel and a certain bot command is ran.

# Usage

To set a channel for bot here is what you need to do: run the following command and mention a channel else the bot will set the channel in which you ran the command. 
```
cool channel <#mention a channel (forget this field if you want to use the current channel)>
```

# how to reset a channel? 

Well just re run the command in the same manner. 

# how to remove a bot response channel? 

At moment I hadn't made any command to remove the current channel I may in future probably but it will take long since I've atleast 200+ commands to change things in. 

# why can't I sent the channel? 

Channels can only be set by a user in server who has manage channel (my bot doesn't actually see whether you're a owner or have administrator permission it looks only for manage channel perms I'm working on changing it).
